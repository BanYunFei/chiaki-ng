# `chiaki4deck` Updates

This section covers the updates to Chiaki in `chiaki4deck`. Updates that are currently done (implemented) are listed in the [Done section](done.md){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} along with details, while updates that are planned for the future are listed in the [Planned section](planned.md){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

!!! Question "Why These Updates?"

    I have simply chosen to update things that would give me a better experience with Chiaki on my Steam Deck. Given the current state of the Chiaki project (maintenance mode), I'm not sure if the maintainers will accept new changes. I have submitted the current updates upstream to Chiaki and hope :fingers_crossed: that they are accepted despite Chiaki being in maintenance mode. In the meantime, I have created `chiaki4deck` as a means to distribute these changes to others using the Steam Deck as well as others wanting to add additional beneficial features on top of mine. Currently, I am aiming to make `chiaki4deck` work for all traditional Chiaki users (may not benefit other users as much as Steam Deck users, but wouldn't be bad for those users either).
