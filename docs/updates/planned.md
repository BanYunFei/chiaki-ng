# Future Updates Planned

## Enable Gyro Controls with Steam Deck Controller

Currently, you can map the Steam Deck controller's gyro to work `As Joystick` to use for camera controls in games with traditional camera controls. However, you can't use it natively in games that directly implement gyro controls like `Concrete Genie`. This update will change that.
