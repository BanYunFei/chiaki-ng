# Future Updates Planned

## Enable Touchpad and Gyro Controls with DualSense/DualShock 4 Controller for Flatpak

Currently, the DualSense/DualShock 4 touchpad and gyro controls work with the binary version of `chiaki` but don't work with the flatpak version. I will update `chiaki4deck` to make it as easy as possible for Steam Deck users to enable this if they use a DualSense or DualShock 4 with their Steam Deck, including providing instructions for setup and use.

## Enable Touchpad and Gyro Controls with Steam Deck Controller

Currently, the Steam Deck controller can map its touchscreen, touchpads and gyro to various different controls but can use neither native touchpad (touchpad click is supported via the ++t++ key mapping but touchpad gestures such as those in `Ghost of Tsushima` are not supported) nor native gyro inputs (gyro can be mapped to work `As Joystick` to use for camera controls in games with traditional camera controls but can't be used natively in games that directly implement them like `Concrete Genie`).
