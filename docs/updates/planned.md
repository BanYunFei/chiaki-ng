# Future Updates Planned

## Enable Microphone

Enable using a microphone for in game interactivity and voice chat.

## Guide for Using Remote Play Outside of Home network

Write a documentation page on setting up remote play outside of your home network. Additionally, add updates if necessary to the code to make this process as easy as possible, similar to the experience with the official PS Remote Play application.

## Update Haptics from Experimental

After feedback and potential future improvements (if necessary), graduate haptics to a regular (default enabled) vs. experimental future.
